Business Intelligence Project

## üìå Background
Flight delays and cancellations continue to be a major challenge for the airline industry, leading to passenger frustration and operational inefficiencies. This project utilizes data warehousing, ETL, machine learning, and visualization techniques to analyze historical flight data, uncover trends, and generate actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze historical flight data to identify trends in delays and cancellations
- Determine key factors contributing to flight disruptions
- Perform sentiment analysis on airline reviews to assess passenger sentiment
- Design and implement a Data Warehouse (DW) using a Star Schema
- Develop interactive dashboards for real-time insights and decision-making

## üìÇ Project Components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Datasets
Flight Delays & Cancellations (3M+ records, 30+ attributes) ‚Äì Sourced from Kaggle.
Airline Customer Reviews (23K+ reviews) ‚Äì Provides insights into passenger experiences, sourced from Kaggle.
Airport Metadata (380 records) ‚Äì Scraped for additional contextual information.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized attributes.
Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob and NLTK (VADER) were used to classify airline reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
Feature Engineering: Derived key attributes to enhance predictive analysis.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Warehouse Design & ETL
Star Schema: Built a dimensional model with key dimensions such as Airlines, Airports, Date, Cancellations, and Reviews.
Fact Table: Stores flight-related data, including delays, cancellations, departure, and arrival details.
ETL Pipeline: Implemented using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for seamless data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2): Applied for tracking changes in airport details over time.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization & Dashboards
Key Dashboards:
1. Net Promoter Score (NPS) Dashboard
  - Evaluates airline reputation using Promoters, Passives, and Detractors.
  - Analyzes customer satisfaction trends for individual airlines.
2. Airline Performance Dashboard
  - Examines flight delays and cancellations by airline.
  - Investigates root causes of delays, including Carrier, Weather, Security, NAS, and Late Aircraft.
3. Real-Time Flight Tracker Dashboard
  - Monitors live flight status updates.
  - Tracks delays and reasons for disruptions in real time.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, TextBlob)
SQL Server (ETL, SSIS)
Visio (Star Schema)
Power BI (Data Visualization, Dashboards)
Jupyter Notebooks (EDA, Sentiment Analysis)
Kaggle (Data Source)

## üìú Business Implications
The insights derived from this project offer value to multiple stakeholders including:
- Airline Management: Identify and mitigate operational inefficiencies leading to delays and cancellations.
- Customer Service Teams: Address passenger concerns from reviews to improve overall satisfaction.
- Investors & Analysts: Leverage NPS and performance metrics to assess airline reputation.
- Passengers: Make data-driven decisions when selecting airlines based on reviews and reliability scores.
